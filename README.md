# Titanic_survival
I built a machine learning model so that it can predict whether this person survives the Titanic ship sinking (Kaggle Project)

In this project, I first examined the train and test data by applying some statistics and visualizations
Then, I identified the problem with the data set and put some clear points to the problem
After that, I preprocessed the data and cleaned it so it would be suitable for the model
Then, I tried different models on the data and evaluated them using (CV) to get the best model
Then, I tried to tune the models to see if I would get better results and actually, I got better results
Then, I ensampled two models using soft voting modeling and then that was my final model
Then, I ended up making predictions using my model on the test data (submission file included)
